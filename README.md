This project is an implemantation of the system developed in a result of my bachelor diploma's work.

Using various [ROS](http://wiki.ros.org/) packages this project implements so called autonomous robot return system (_ARRS_). Details can be found in the paper [Towards development of reliable mobile robot navigation system](https://github.com/denzist/robot-navigation/blob/master/Towards%20development%20of%20reliable%20mobile%20robot%20navigation%20system.pdf). 

More details can be found in a [wiki](https://github.com/denzist/robot_navigation/wiki).
